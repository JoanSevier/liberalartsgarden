Chapter 1 of [[The Trivium (SMJ)\|The Trivium (SMJ)]] by [[Sister Miriam Joseph\|Sister Miriam Joseph]]. It serves as an introduction to the concept of the [[Seven Liberal Arts\|Seven Liberal Arts]] in general.

## Outline of the Chapter
1. The Liberal Arts
	1. The trivium: the three arts of language (pertaining to mind)
		1. Logic, the art of thinking
		2. Grammar, the art of inventing symbols and combining them to express thought
		3. Rhetoric, the art of communicating thought from one mind to another, the adaptation of language to circumstance
	2. The quadrivium: the four arts of quantity (pertaining to matter)
		1. Discrete quantity, or number
			1. Arithmetic, the theory of number
			2. Music, and application of the theory of number, the measurement of discrete quantities in motion
		2. Continuous quantity (extension, or space)
			1. Geometry, the theory of space
			2. Astronomy, an application of the theory of space

These Seven Liberal Arts differ from the many Utilitarian Arts and from the Seven Fine Arts. These latter sets of Arts are *transitive*, acting on an object, while the Liberal Arts are *intransitive*, meaning that they are reflexive, an action of an agent with no outside object.

There are three classes of goods:
1. Valuable goods, which increase the worth of their possessor
2. Useful goods, which enable their possessor to acquire valuable goods
3. Pleasurable goods, which give satisfaction to their possessor

Each liberal art is both an *art* and a *science* because each of them comes with something to know (science) and something to do (art).

The trivium is the instrument of all education, because it is the set of arts of communication.

“Education is the highest of arts in the sense that it imposes forms (ideas and ideals) not on matter…but on mind; and these forms are received by the pupil not passively but through active cooperation. In true liberal education…the essential activity of the student is to relate the facts he learns into a unified organic whole.”

Education in the trivium trains the mind to study the sum of reality.

2. Relations of the arts of language
	1. Relations to reality
		1. Metaphysics is concerned with the thing-as-it-exists
		2. Logic is concerned with the thing-as-it-is-known
		3. Grammar is concerned with the thing-as-it-is-symbolized
		4. Rhetoric is concerned with the thing-as-it-is-communicated from one mind to another by means of symbols
	2. Materials, functions, and norms of the arts of language
		1. Phonetics (a part of Grammar) prescribes how to combine sounds so as to form spoken words correctly
		2. Spelling (a part of Grammar) prescribes how to combine letters so as to form written words correctly
		3. Grammar prescribes how to combine words so as to form sentences correctly
		4. Rhetoric prescribes how to combine sentences into paragraphs and paragraphs into a whole composition having unity, coherence, and the desired emphasis, as well as clearness, force, and beauty.
		5. Logic prescribes how to combine concepts into judgments and judgments into syllogisms and chains of reasoning so as to achieve truth.

The arts of language are normative in that they seek to regulate rather than speculative in seeking only to know.

Correctness is the norm of Grammar, Effectiveness is the norm of Rhetoric, and Truth is the norm of Logic.

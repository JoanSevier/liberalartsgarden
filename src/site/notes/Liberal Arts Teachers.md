Persons who throughout history have revived and promulgated the study of the [[Seven Liberal Arts\|Seven Liberal Arts]].

This list could never exhaustive, but it does give the names of several critically important figures in the history of the Liberal Arts and opens onto their individual insights concerning the Arts, usually in the form of outlines of their books.

Some of the Liberal Arts Teachers include:
[[Martianus Capella\|Martianus Capella]]
[[Augustine\|Augustine]]
[[Cassiodorus\|Cassiodorus]]
[[Boethius\|Boethius]]
[[Isidore of Seville\|Isidore of Seville]]
[[Alcuin of York\|Alcuin of York]]
[[John Scotus Eriugena\|John Scotus Eriugena]]
[[Hugh of St. Victor\|Hugh of St. Victor]]
[[John of Salisbury\|John of Salisbury]]
[[Lorenzo Valla\|Lorenzo Valla]]
[[Mortimer J. Adler\|Mortimer J. Adler]]
[[Sister Miriam Joseph\|Sister Miriam Joseph]]

Many authors made considerable advances in the fields studied by the Liberal Artist without viewing their work as a conscious reflection on the Seven Liberal Arts. These fall into two classes:

First, there are thinkers who were important *precursors* to and sources for the Liberal Arts. These are principally Greek and Roman authors (though these have their basis on the largely anonymous learning of Ancient Egypt). The most important of these include [[Pythagoras\|Pythagoras]], [[Plato\|Plato]], [[Aristotle\|Aristotle]], [[Porphyry\|Porphyry]], [[Quintilian\|Quintilian]], [[The Stoics\|The Stoics]], [[Priscian\|Priscian]], [[Euclid\|Euclid]], [[Ptolemy\|Ptolemy]], and many, many others.

Second, there are specialists through history who elaborate on the domains of the Liberal Arts or in the field of education philosophy more broadly. I include here only those persons or movements that I find important for my own formulation of the Seven Liberal Arts. These include: [[Charles Sanders Peirce\|Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[John Amos Comenius\|John Amos Comenius]], [[Natural Semantic Metalanguage\|Natural Semantic Metalanguage]], and others.

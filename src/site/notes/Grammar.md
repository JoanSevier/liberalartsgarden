## Divisions
Grammar may be divided along multiple different axes.

The simplest division is a division of tense, such that we speak of [[Diachronic Grammar\|Diachronic Grammar]] (or philology) and [[Synchronic Grammar\|Synchronic Grammar]] (or linguistics. Diachronic Grammar is the study of human language systems over periods of time, while Synchronic Grammar studies human languages in particular places and times. The names “philology” and “linguistics” used in this way are ambiguous but less technical.

We may also divide Grammar according to class. [[General Grammar\|General Grammar]] is the study of the relationships of linguistic signs to thoughts. [[Specific Grammar\|Specific Grammar]] is the study of relationships of linguistic signs to other linguistic signs. [[Individual Grammar\|Individual Grammar]] is the study of the relationships of signs in an individual language to other signs in that same language.

Finally, we may divide Grammar according to its many distinct objects. [[Phonology\|Phonology]] is the study of the basic elements that constitute signs in language, called *phonemes* or, sometimes, *letters*. [[Morphology\|Morphology]] is the study of the most basic *meaningful* elements constituting signs in language, called *morphemes*. [[Lexicology\|Lexicology]] is the study of the most basic elements that constitute signs in language that are *independently referential*, called *words* or *lexemes*. [[Semantics\|Semantics]] is the study of the relationship of signs in language to meaning. [[Syntax\|Syntax]] is the study of relationships between elements constituting signs in language, such relationships producing *phrases,* *clauses*, and *sentences*.

Grammar is itself a division of the Trivium, and arguably a division of [[Semiotics\|Semiotics]].

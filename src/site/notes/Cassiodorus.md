Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus Senator (c. 485 â€“ c. 585 A.D.) was a Roman Christian who worked as an administrator for the Ostrogoth rulers of Rome before retiring to a monastery in Calabria he named *Vivarium*.

He wrote many works, but his most popular is his [[Institutions\|Institutions of Divine and Secular Learning]], a work written for the education of monks at the Vivarium. The latter part of this work is dedicated to the [[Seven Liberal Arts\|Seven Liberal Arts]]. That alone from his age would make him a celebrated [[Liberal Arts Teachers\|Liberal Arts Teacher]], but he also wrote on orthography, in addition to volumes of state papers, commentaries on the Bible, histories, and more.

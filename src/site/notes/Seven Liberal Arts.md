A collection of interrelated disciplines condensed from late-antique Roman culture and used as the foundation of higher learning in Western European traditions of education. 

Historical sources considered these arts to be named “liberal” for different reasons. Most state that these are the fields of learning appropriate to the formation of free individuals, some that they are the arts most necessary for children, and some say it is because they pertain to books. All these diverse etymologies come from the fact that the Latin words for *free*, *child*, and *book* are all *liber!*

These arts are organized into two groups: the [[Trivium\|Trivium]] or the three Liberal Arts of Literacy, and the [[Quadrivium\|Quadrivium]] or the Four Liberal Arts of Numeracy.

The Liberal Arts are often understood in historical sources as discovered rather than invented. Still, the form of the Liberal Arts and the methods of teaching them arise thanks to the immortal work of history’s [[Liberal Arts Teachers\|Liberal Arts Teachers]].

A collection of interrelated disciplines condensed from late-antique Roman culture. Considered to be the fields of learning appropriate to the formation of free individuals.

These arts are organized into two groups: the [[Trivium\|Trivium]] or the three Liberal Arts of Literacy, and the [[Quadrivium\|Quadrivium]] or the Four Liberal Arts of Numeracy.

The Liberal Arts are often understood in historical sources as discovered rather than invented. Still, the form of the Liberal Arts and the methods of teaching them arise thanks to the immortal work of historyâ€™s [[Liberal Arts Teachers\|Liberal Arts Teachers]].

The authors and writings that set the stage for the later development of the [[Seven Liberal Arts\|Seven Liberal Arts]].

This is a remarkably wide category of persons, movements, and texts!
## Ancient Egypt and the Near East
The Liberal Arts as Western Europe understood them actually began in [[Ancient Egypt\|Ancient Egypt]], which pioneered scientific and literary writing in ways many today rarely hear about (and when it is popularly discussed, it is often through the racist mythos of “ancient alien theorists”). Considerable influence also comes from cultures further east in Mesopotamia. In these settings most sources are anonymous, but their ingenuity in Mathematics, [[Astronomy\|Astronomy]], and literature is doubtless.

The debt owed to the Egyptians and Mesopotamians, as well as the Iranians, was more often acknowledged by earlier authors and “pagans” than later Christian authors.
## Ancient Greece
The Greeks may not have been the earliest, but they were the most influential of the predecessors to the Liberal Arts tradition, such that they set the terms for all later discussions of the Arts. Among the “Pre-Platonic” philosophers, [[Pythagoras\|Pythagoras]] made clear the systematic nature of mathematical learning, Socrates advanced logic, and rhetoric grew from the theories of the Sophists and the practicalities of political life.

It was [[Plato\|Plato]] that most comprehensively brought the inheritance of Greek thought together, though it was [[Aristotle\|Aristotle]] that explicated the Liberal Arts as we understand them today.
## Hellenistic and Roman Developments
Later developments largely develop on this Platonic-Peripatetic inheritance. Of particular note are the Neoplatonists, such as [[Porphyry\|Porphyry]], who wrote important works on Aristotle, and Romans like [[Cicero\|Cicero]] and [[Quintilian\|Quintilian]], who pioneered Latin-language reception of Greek logic and rhetoric.

It was also this in period of time that, as Latin and Greek became international languages, that reflection on the [[Grammar\|Grammar]] of each language and how to teach it became a necessity. From these projects, the actual frame of the Liberal Arts began, and could be brought together during [[The Consolidation\|The Consolidation]].

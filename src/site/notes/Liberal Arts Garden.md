Welcome to the *Liberal Arts Garden*! This site is published from the Obsidian vault of Catherine McKinney, and documents my notetaking on the [[Seven Liberal Arts\|Seven Liberal Arts]] and related inquiries. 

Disclaimer: the way I use terms in my notes here are my own; though they usually have a basis in the sources I am working with, it is best to assume that my usage here is made for this context; don’t go into the outside world and use terms such as “Three Renaissances” or “Special Lexicology” and expect people to know just what you mean. While I stand by the utility of these terms, they are necessarily idiosyncratic.

Here are some good starting places:

[[History of the Seven Liberal Arts\|History of the Seven Liberal Arts]]
[[Classical Education\|Classical Education]]
